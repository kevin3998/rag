Introduction Nanofiltration has various industrial applications, such as drinking water production, food processing (e.g., dairy industry) and wastewater treatment, owing to its higher separation performance (e.g., high permeability) at relatively lower hydraulic pressure compared to reverse osmosis (RO). Novel materials, such as two-dimensional (2D) materials, opens a new avenue to assembly nanofiltration membranes [1]. As one of the earliest exfoliated 2D materials, graphene-based materials have gained numerous studies and show the potential as building blocks for assembling high-performance membranes [2]. Among them, graphene oxide (GO) membranes are gaining attention in nanofiltration since the emergence of graphene oxide, which can be easily assembled into laminar membrane by various approaches, e.g., vacuum filtration, spin-coating and dip-coating methods [3]. To improve the practicality of GO membrane in water separation, different strategies, e.g., reduction [4,5], crosslinking [6–8] and surface modification [9], have been adopted to inhibit swelling [10] and enhance the GO membrane stability [11,12]. By partially removing the in-plane oxygen functional groups from GO nanosheets, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) membranes can be feasibly prepared and those membranes have shown promise for nanofiltration [4,13,14]. Thermal reduction is one of the commonly used post-treatment methods to prepare rGO membranes, which can effectively improve the stability of GO-based membranes as well as tune the membrane selectivity [5,15]. Nevertheless, several challenges are need to be addressed before the practical application of rGO membranes, e.g., low permeability and selectivity than theoretic calculation [16]. Research on 2D laminar membranes, especially GO-based membranes, advances our knowledge about mass transport within nano- confined channels as well as paves the way toward designing better membranes. Studies found that reduction in membrane thickness (e.g., below 100 nm) effectively improve the permeability of GO membrane but sacrifice the selectivity [4,9,17]. In addition, by introducing in-plane nanopores into graphene oxide nanosheets, more transport pathways and shorter transport distance can be achieved, thus improving membrane permeability. Regardless, the membrane selectivity is still determined by laminar channels and charge properties [5,18]. Recently, laminar channels and their impact on membrane performance are gaining attention. Those transport channels may evolve during the membrane assembly [19], drying [20] as well as the post-treatment processes [21]. Experimental evidence reveals that a more ordered laminar structure benefits membrane separation, e.g., GO membrane prepared by a slower self-assembly of graphene oxide nanosheets through vacuum filtration exhibited both higher salt rejection and water * Corresponding author.

As the filtration process getting slower, the layer-by-layer stacking patterns become more ordered. In another study, assembly of GO laminates through different assembly methods (vacuum-filtrated, pressure-filtrated and evaporation assemblies) result in a difference in the order degree of laminar microstructures, while a more ordered structure exhibits better pervaporation performance [22]. In terms of rGO membrane prepared by thermal treatment, it is worth noting that relatively high-thermal temperatures exceed 120 C and vacuum as the reduction atmosphere, were adopted for preparation of rGO membranes in previous work [15, 23,24]. By contrast, a mild-annealing treatment also showed promise for synthesis of rGO membrane at relatively lower thermal temperature of 80 C, although it was used for membrane drying [25,26]. Actually, transformation of oxygen functionalities occurs together with structure evolution but happens relatively slower during this mild reduction [27]. As corrugation of GO nanosheets impairs the order degree of 2D laminar channels during reduction process [25,28], a relatively milder reduction condition might favour the formation of a more ordered and better-controlled transport channels compared to a higher thermal temperature. On the other hand, it is worth noting that the oxygen species that related to membrane performance are mostly remained due to the mild-thermal reduction, whether the resultant membrane can be applied for nanofiltration remains unclear. Moreover, the understanding of how reduction conditions affect the laminar nanostructures and how interlayer nanostructures, in turn, determine the permeation characteristics is needed for better understanding of structure-performance relationship of the 2D membranes. In this work, we demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of the mild-thermal annealing at 80 C for preparing rGO-based nanofiltration membrane for dye and Na2SO4 separation. The dynamic change of membrane structure during the mild annealing process were systematically characterized, and the impact of the mild-thermal annealing on membrane performance was explored. In addition, the mild thermal reduced graphene oxide (MRGO) membrane was compared with a high- thermal-temperature reduced GO membrane (HRGO) with the same average laminar (2D) channels to investigate the impact of thermal temperature on channel structure. Finally, the mechanism for their different separation performance was proposed to better understand the water/ions transport within the 2D laminar channels. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Materials GO solution (10 g/L) was supplied by SupraG Australia and was diluted to 100 mg/L with Milli-Q water for membrane preparation (Fig. S1a). Commercial polyethersulfone (PES) filters with an average pore size of 30 nm were obtained from Sterlitech Corporation (USA) for membrane synthesis. NaCl, MgCl2, Na2SO4 and MgSO4 were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further treatment. 2.2. Preparation of rGO membranes by mild-thermal treatment As illustrated in Fig. 1, GO membranes were assembled by a simple vacuum filtration of GO solution through a PES substrate. After totally dry the membranes in a vacuum drier for 12 h, rGO membranes were prepared by thermally reducing the GO membranes in an oven at 80 C in air atmosphere for a certain time. The resultant rGO membranes were stored in the plastic Petri dishes before membrane test. 2.3. Comparison with the high-thermal-annealing reduced graphene oxide membrane To evacuate the difference between high-thermal and mild- annealing reduced GO membranes, we prepared two membranes at different thermal temperatures, i.e., one membrane was prepared at 150 C (HRGO), and another one was prepared at 80 C (MRGO). To make a reasonable comparison, we firstly characterized the dynamic change of the interlayer spacing toward the high-thermal annealing treatment to determine a suitable time when two membranes exhibit the same interlayer space (laminar channel); thus we could expect to find out the structure difference when the effective laminar channels are the same. Finally, MRGO with a mild-thermal time of 25 h at 80 C and HRGO with a thermal time of 0.5 h were chosen for the comparison. 2.4. Membrane test Membrane testing, including the water flux and salt rejection, were conducted on a dead-end filtration system (Sterlitech, P4750, shown in Fig. S2). The driving force comes from the compressed nitrogen gas from a cylinder to provide a constant transmembrane pressure (P) of 4 bar, which was monitored by a pressure gage. The effective membrane area was 8.55 cm2. Water flux was determined by measuring the mass change of permeate water every minute using an electronic balance for 2 h. The normalized water flux was calculated based on the equation below, J ¼ m ρAtP (1) where J is the normalized water flux (Lm2 h1 bar1, abbreviated as LMH/bar), ρ is density of water (1 kg/L), m represents the mass of permeate (kg), A is the effective membrane area (m2), and t denotes the time interval (h). Meanwhile, the salt rejection performance of these membranes was evaluated using 1 g/L NaCl, Na2SO4, MgSO4, and MgCl2 solutions, respectively. The concentrations of these salts in the feed (Cp) and permeate (Cp) solutions were determined by a standardized digital conductivity meter (Labchem, Australia). The salt rejection (Rsalt%) was calculated according to the following formula, Rsalt% ¼ 1 Cp Cf 100% (2) The separation factors (α) of Na2SO4 to NaCl, MgSO4 and MgCl2 were determined by the following equations, aðNa2SO4=NaClÞ ¼ 100% RNaCl 100% RNa2SO4 (3) aðNa2SO4=MgSO4Þ ¼ 100% RMgSO4 100% RNa2SO4 (4) aðNa2SO4=MgCl2Þ ¼ 100% RNa2SO4 100% RMgCl2 (5) Fig. 1. Facile preparation of the MRGO membrane. Y. Li et al. Journal of Membrane Science 601 (2020) 117900 3 2.5. Characterization Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai F20 G2, FEI, USA), atomic force microscopy (AFM, JPK NanoWizard II, JPK Instruments AG, Germany), and light dynamic scattering (DLS, Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS, UK) were employed to characterize the GO nanosheets used in this work. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Nova NanoSEM 450, FEI, USA) and AFM (Dimension Icon, USA) in tapping mode with Bruker silicon probes (MPP-21100-10) were used to investigate the morphologies of the assembled membranes. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (D2 Phaser powder diffractometer, Bruker, Germany) was adopted to determine the effective channel size (interlayer space) of the membranes. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Kratos Ltd., Telford, UK) (details provided in supporting information) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (PerkinElmer, USA) were used to analyze the effect of thermal treatment on these membranes. To reduce the impact from the substrate (PES), we transferred MRGO/HRGPO membranes onto silica wafers for AFM characterization and prepared thicker membranes (500 nm) for XRD and XPS characterization. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Characterization of MRGO membranes The physical properties of GO used in this work were evaluated by TEM and AFM (Fig. S3). Accordingly, we found the lateral size of the GO is several micrometres while the thickness of the graphene oxide is ~1 nm, indicating that the GO is mostly single-layer GO in this work. To examine the impact of the mild-annealing process, we investigated the X-ray diffraction patterns of the MRGO (Fig. 2c). Accordingly, the GO exhibited a characteristic peak (001) at 10.85, corresponding to an interlayer space of 8.15 Å. After the thermal treatment, characteristic peak (001) continually shift towards a higher degree, indicating the laminar channels became narrower when increasing the thermal treatment time. Moreover, the peak intensity keeps decreasing due to the removal of functional groups and the formation of defects on the graphene basal planes. After thermally treated for 70 h, the interlayer space of the laminar channel decreased from 7.96 to 6.93 Å, proving the mild annealing process can be used for the reduction of GO membranes into rGO membranes. Additionally, inhibited swelling of the laminar channels was also observed after the mild-annealing treatment, i.e., MRGO membranes exhibited limited swelling degree in water compared to the pure GO membrane, which is beyond the detection limit of the instrumentation and diameter of the swelling channel size decreased from 13.65 to 9.03 Å with the mild-annealing time increased from 0 to 70 h (Fig. S4), thus enabling higher rejection rates of hydrated salt ions. XPS and FTIR were employed to understand the change of chemical properties of the rGO membranes. From XPS result shown in Fig. 3a and b and Table S1, mild annealing resulted in a reduced oxygen atomic% concentration from 28.3 0.1% to 27.6 0.1% with the O/C ratio slight decreased from 0.4 to 0.39 after a 25 h treatment, but the oxygen content almost remained constant afterwards when further increasing the treatment time. The C3 (C–O, mainly OH-) ratio decreases at the similar trend with atomic oxygen concentration, which may include the removal of intercalated water molecules. By comparison, the C4 (mainly C¼O and O–C–O) concentration decreased slightly and no significant change can be observed for the atomic ratios of C5 (COOR). Generally, XPS spectra focus on the surface change (~10 nm in depth), while FTIR spectra reach microscale since the wavelength covers a much wider range than XPS [29]. According to FTIR spectra (Fig. 3c and d), the –OH (hydroxyl) stretching vibration at ~3400 cm1 showed notable decrease by mild-annealing treatment, while the epoxy or peroxide (C–O–C) group peak at 1270 cm1 increased when thermal annealing time was increased due to the esterification reaction within the neighbouring GO nanosheets. Similar to XPS, the C¼O stretching (mainly COOH) remains unchanged in response to the mild annealing process, indicating COOH could not be effectively removed through mild annealing. To conclude, the mild annealing process showed limited reduction ability due to the mild-thermal temperature, but we still observed some physiochemical changes during this process. In addition, the surface of membranes became darker (from yellow to brown, Fig. S5) after the mild thermal treatment, which is a common phenomenon after GO reduction. Additionally, MRGO membrane exhibited reduced hydrophilicity and surface charge, i.e., contact angle (Fig. S6) values increased from 37.06to Fig. 2. (a) Top-view and (b) cross-sectional SEM images of MRGO membrane. (c) XRD spectra and (d) corresponding change of interlayer space of MRGO membranes treated at 80 C for different time. Y. Li et al. Journal of Membrane Science 601 (2020) 117900 4 49.77and zeta potential (Fig. S7) values increased from 99.39 4.43 to 87.3 1.60 mV after a mild annealing of 70 h. These results provide further evidence of the partial reduction ability of mild annealing. Based on the above results, evolution of functional groups took place during mild annealing due to removal of –OH groups [30] as well as esterification reaction that cross-linked the neighbouring graphene oxide nanosheets [31]. 3.2. Impact of mild annealing on membrane performance The impact of the mild annealing on rGO membrane performance was evaluated on a dead-end filtration device. According to the results (Fig. 4a), water permeance of the membranes decreased significantly from 7.37 0.9 to 3.99 0.49 LMH/bar after thermally treated for 5 h at 80 C, while the salt rejection increased from 57.73 0.83% to 90.90 0.49% for Na2SO4 due to the narrowing of the laminar channels after reduction [11]. Afterwards, the water permeance of MRGO membranes kept decreasing along with the increase in salt rejection at a relatively slower rate. Almost total rejection of Na2SO4 was achieved after a mild annealing time of 70 h, demonstrating that the salt rejection of rGO membrane can be feasibly adjusted by mild annealing process. Besides, other salt solutions, NaCl, MgSO4, and MgCl2 were also tested. Similar to previous rGO membrane, the separation of four different salt solutions follows the sequence of Na2SO4>NaCl MgSO4 >MgCl2, indicating the dominant role of Donnan exclusion effect in salt rejection. It is worth noting that MRGO membrane showed the highest salt selectivity of Na2SO4/MgCl2; in addition, the salt selectivity of four solutions also increased with the mild annealing time. To be specific, the initial separation factor of Na2SO4 towards other salts were only 2.06 (Na2SO4/NaCl), 2.06 (Na2SO4/MgSO4) and 2.26 (Na2SO4/MgCl2), respectively. However, these values increased by more than 8.5 times to 17.83 (Na2SO4/NaCl), 18.36 (Na2SO4/MgSO4) and 30.39 (Na2SO4/MgCl2), respectively. The performance of GO membrane in this study is compared with those reported in the literatures (Table S2), the relatively lower water permeance can be attributed to the narrow interlayer space (7.96 Å) of the GO membrane and the small pore radius of the PES substrate (30 nm). The impact of hydraulic pressure on the MRGO membranes was investigated by increasing the pressure from 1 bar to 6 bar and reduced again to 1 bar (Fig. S8a). The average water permeance of rGO membrane showed a linear response towards the hydraulic pressure, indicating laminar structure of MRGO membrane is relatively compact. By Fig. 3. (a) XPS spectra and (b) corresponding change of the oxygen species (c) FTIR and (d) corresponding change of the functional groups of MRGO membranes treated at 80 C for different time. Fig. 4. Impact of thermal treatment time on (a) water permeance, (b) salt rejection and (c) salt selectivity of rGO membranes treated at 80 C for different time. Y. Li et al. Journal of Membrane Science 601 (2020) 117900 5 contrast, pure GO membrane is relatively more loosely packed and thereby go through a process of compaction with increasing hydraulic pressure [19]. As a result, the pressure versus flux relationship may not be linear but a curve for a GO membrane. Hence, the MRGO membrane is actually densely packed. To better understand the separation performance, the molecule weight cut-off of the MRGO membrane with a thermal annealing time of 25 h was evaluated by different dye molecules shown in Fig. S8b. Accordingly, we found that the MWCO of the MRGO membrane is about 600 Da, making it suitable for nanofiltration. To explore the stability of MRGO membrane, stability testings were carried out on a home-made cross-flow device. As shown in Fig. S9, there is no apparent decrease (less than 2%) for the slat rejection of the MRGO membrane while 15% decrease for the pristine GO membrane, which proves further evidences on the stability of MRGO membranes. 3.3. Comparison of the mild and high-thermal annealing processes It is worth to understand the difference between the mild-thermal annealing and the commonly adopted high-thermal annealing treatment for rGO membrane preparation. The impact of high-thermal annealing treatment on laminar channel of HRGO is shown in Fig. S10. According to the dynamic change of XRD results, two membranes, named HRGO and MRGO, were prepared at 150 C and 80 C, respectively. Based on cross-sectional SEM images of the MRGO and HRGO, the two former is ~10 nm thinner than the latter (Fig. S11). In addition, these two membrane showed almost the same laminar channels of 9.51 Å when immersed in water (Fig. S12). According to experimental results, MRGO showed a 70% higher water permeance and similar Na2SO4 rejection (~90%) compared to that of HRGO. By contrast, MRGO showed much lower rejection toward NaCl, MgSO4, and MgCl2. As a result, the MRGO possessed a higher salt selectivity towards the Na2SO4 than the other tested salt solutions, indicating the advantage of mild-thermal annealing for preparing high-selective rGO membranes. The separation behaviour (R(Na2SO4) > R(MgSO4) R(NaCl) > R (MgCl2)) of these two membranes is in accordance to the Donnan exclusion theory that govern by their negative charge surface [5]. It is noted that only 0.5 h is needed for the former to reach the same average laminar channels as the latter that reduced at 80 C for 25 h, which is shown in Fig. 5c and Fig. S7. Besides, both XPS (Table S3 and Fig. S13) and FTIR (Fig. S14) characterizations showed that HRGO and MRGO showed similar change of functional groups, but the latter showed slightly lower oxygen content (26.22%) compared to the latter (27.38%) due to the stronger reduction ability of high-thermal temperature. By comparison, mild annealing process is relatively a much slower and less reductive process. 3.4. Analysis of membrane nanostructure and separation mechanism To better understand the separation difference of these two membranes prepared at different temperatures, their surface morphology were studied by SEM and AFM. As shown in Fig. 6, MRGO shows a smoother surface morphology compared to that of HRGO. To be specific, more wrinkled morphology can be observed directly from the top surface of HRGO compared to MRGO. To be more specific, the former possessed a larger roughness of 4.50 nm than the latter (3.61 nm). In addition, the height profile of the HRGO membrane acquired from 3D AFM further confirms the less undulating of the MRGO membrane with a Z-axis fluctuate within 14.7 nm, while that of HRGO was 21.8 nm on the same silica substrate. As the surface morphology is closely related to the laminar structure, these results indicate the laminar channel of MRGO membrane is more ordered compared to HRGO membrane. Moreover, the full width half maximum values of GO (001) XRD peaks were plotted against the annealing time (Fig. S15). As shown in Fig. S15, both FWHM values increased at the beginning when heated. However, the FWHM of GO treated by mild-annealing started to decrease after 10 h while that treated by high-thermal annealing kept increasing from 1.24 to 2.15 with the annealing time ranging from 0 to 60 min. By comparison, the FWHM of GO changed slightly from 1.24 to 1.31 after a mild-annealing treatment of 70 h. In addition, for the MRGO membrane and HRGO membrane with the same average laminar channel, the FWHM of the former (1.36) is much narrower than the latter (2.1), which can be another evidence that mild annealing resulted in a more ordered laminar structure. During thermal annealing process, collapse of the laminar channels occurs due to the removal of functional groups, leading to shrink of the laminar structure. It is suspected that mild thermal annealing causes a much slower process compared to high thermal annealing, leading to a more ordered structure. Actually, based on our experiments, it took the former 25 h and the latter 0.5 h to reach the same average interlayer space. The interlayer spaces estimated from XRD characteristic 001 peak represent the average diameter of the laminar channel, which means some parts are above the average while some others are below the average. Although MRGO and HRGO possessed the same interlayer space, the laminar channels are more ordered in MRGO membrane with a narrow distribution of channel diameter. To conclude, the mild thermal reduction is not only a slower reduction process compare to the high thermal reduction, but also leads to a more ordered laminar structure that enables a better membrane performance. The proposed separation mechanism is shown in Fig. 7, mild-thermal treatment resulted in a relatively more uniform 2D channels than the high thermal process (Fig. 7b), and channel diameters within the MRGO are similar. By contrast, laminar structures within the HRGO is more complex, which can be divided into three zones with different Fig. 5. (a) MRGO and HRGO with the same (001) characteristic peak position (interlayer space); (b) water permeance and (c) salt rejection of MRGO and HRGO membranes with the same effective laminar channel. Y. Li et al. Journal of Membrane Science 601 (2020) 117900 6 diameters. As shown in Fig. 7d, Zone 1 refers to the area where channel size is smaller than the average, while Zone II represents the area where channel size larger than the average and that of Zone 3 is same as the average diameter. Therefore, the permeation of water and salt ions within the HRGO is relatively more complex, i.e., water molecules and salt ions meet with higher resistance in Zone 1 but lower resistance in Zone 2. The limiting factor for the water/ions transport within HRGO is supposed to be Zone 1, where the channel size is smaller than average, due to that fact that water/ions have to pass through the Zone 1, 2 and 3 in order to permeate the whole channel. By comparison, channel size within the MRGO membrane is relatively more uniform, thus allowing similar transport resistance for water and salt ions within the whole passage. As a higher water transport resistance is expected in HRGO membrane, lower water permeance was observed. In terms of salt rejection performance, both size and charge properties contributes to the salt separation in GO-based laminar membranes [5]. Based on the Donnan exclusion theory, salt separation positively relate to the charge valence ratio of the anion (Z) and cation (Zþ), i.e., Z/Zþ (R(Na2SO4) > R(MgSO4) R(NaCl) > R(MgCl2)) [4]. That is the reason why both two membranes show the highest rejection toward Na2SO4 (highest Z/Zþ) but lowest rejection for MgCl2 (lowest Z/Zþ). Besides, the hydrated diameter of SO4 2(7.6 Å) is close to the effective channel size of the laminar channels (~9 Å, Fig. S4 and Fig. S13); thus both achieved similar Na2SO4 rejection. The higher rejection of HRGO membrane for NaCl, MgSO4 and MgCl2 than that of MRGO is attributed to the higher resistance for the hydrated ions within Zone 1 in HRGO membrane than that of MRGO membrane. In conclusion, MRGO showed higher water permeance but higher salt selectivity in this work due to its more ordered laminar structure. 4. Conclusions In this study, mild-thermal annealing was proven to be effective for synthesis of rGO membranes for nanofiltration. The separation performance of the MRGO membranes can be feasibly tuned by controlling the mild-annealing time. Moreover, the salt selectivity can also be effectively improved by prolonging the mild annealing time. Compared to the higher thermal temperature reduced graphene oxide membrane at 150 C, mild annealing treatment was found to be able to prepare rGO membranes with more ordered laminar structure, thus enabling higher water permeance as well as higher salt selectivity. This work helps us to understand the mass transport within laminar channels and the preparation of high-performance rGO membranes for nanofiltration. Fig. 6.

Introduction The citrus processing industry is characterized by the production of a considerable amount of by-products of commercial value including dried pulp and molasses, juice pulps and pulp wash (secondary juice) and d-limonene [1]. These by-products represent a serious environmental problem, since the plant material is usually prone to microbial spoilage and is commonly used in animal feed or as fertilizers. However, most of these materials are enriched in bioactive compounds, such as ﬂavonoids and phenolic acids, recognized for their beneﬁcial implications in human health due to their antioxidant activity and free radical scavenging ability [2]. Therefore, they have a great interest in food, pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical applications, because of their valuable technological and nutritional properties [3]. In this context, evaporator condensate (EC) streams, produced in the juice concentration step by multiple-eﬀect evaporation, represent the largest volume generated in the process. They are used by the industries in many ways, including fruit cleaning/washing, extraction/recovery of solids residual of the pulp, water replacement in the process of peel essential oil recovery, calories recovery for use in Membranes 2020, 10, 92; doi:10.3390/membranes10050092 www.mdpi.com/journal/membranes Membranes 2020, 10, 92 2 of 12 boilers, ﬂoor, equipment and restrooms cleaning [4]. It has been estimated that each kg of frozen juice produces, theoretically, about 4.9 kg of EC streams. The composition of this waste stream is contingent on the eﬃciency of the concentration process. Considering that the eﬃciency of the concentration process is less than 100% (all non-water constituents are desirably retained with the concentrated juice), it results in a waste stream mainly constituted by water carrying over constituents, such as aroma and other volatiles, organic acids and sugars. Among them, aroma compounds have typical odors and have a particularly low detection threshold (about a few micrograms per cubic meter). These compounds are widely used as additives for ﬂavoring foods and medicines or in the perfume and cosmetic industries. In addition, they have been shown to possess antimicrobial [5] and antioxidant activity [6]. Therefore, EC streams may constitute, with selective treatment, a source of molecules of great industrial interest [7,8]. The potential reuse of EC streams in other industrial applications has been largely under-investigated in the existing literature. Coelho et al. [9] reported that the use of ultraﬁltration with cellulose acetate membranes of 30 kDa at 1 bar was eﬀective to remove color and turbidity of recovered water of concentrate orange juice, within the maximum limits established by the Brazilian legislation for bottled water. According to the method patented by Destefano [10], aroma compounds can be recovered from aqueous condensates by high temperature distillation; however, this technology is an energy-intensive, expensive process, especially with these streams that contain relatively small concentrations of organic constituents in large volumes of water. Another speciﬁc problem, particularly when handling citrus essences, is that the high temperatures involved in distillation may destroy the oily portion of the essence, with a resulting loss of quality. Membrane processes, including pervaporation (PV) [11–15], vacuum membrane distillation (VCMD) [16–18] and reverse osmosis (RO) [19–21] represent a valid alternative to the use of thermal distillation, since they use gentle temperatures during the operation and do not involve phase change or chemical additives. In addition, they are characterized by low energy consumption and easy scale-up [22]. In particular, RO is an eﬀective technology to remove organic compounds with low molecular weight and low concentration from aqueous solutions in diﬀerent ﬁelds, including fruit and vegetable juice processing [23]. This technology can eﬀectively double the operating capacity and improve both color and ﬂavor characteristics when compared with thermal evaporation and/or freeze concentration [24]. The retention of juice constituents, especially ﬂavors, and the permeate ﬂux, regarding RO performance, are two major factors, which are related to the type of membranes and the operating conditions used during the process. Early studies by Merson and Morgan [25] found that oil-soluble aromas of orange juice were easily retained by using cellulose acetate (CA) membrane, while there were losses of water-soluble aromas. The production of new polymer membranes, such as those in polyamide (PA), allowed a rapid development of the RO application also in this ﬁeld. Indeed, PA membranes exhibited higher ﬂuxes and ﬂavor retention when compared to CA membranes [26]. Apple ﬂavor retentions of more than 80% were measured when using high resistance polyamide membranes supported on polysulphone membranes [27]. The preferential sorption-capillary ﬂux model was proposed by Álvarez et al. [20], to predict the rejection of aroma compounds and permeate ﬂux in the concentration of a model solution simulating apple juice through a spiral-wound aromatic polyamide membrane. Authors observed that permeate ﬂux and aroma rejection increased with feed ﬂowrate and decreased with sugar concentration. Recently, Tremblay et al. [28] designed and optimized a membrane process based on the use of a RO spiral-wound polyamide membrane to concentrate ﬂavor compounds from cooking eﬄuents generated by snow crab processing facilities, usually considered as waste. The membrane retained almost dissolved solids in the eﬄuent (mainly proteins and minerals), including ﬂavor compounds. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report in the scientiﬁc literature concerning the application of membrane processes for the recovery of aroma compounds from orange juice EC streams. Therefore, Membranes 2020, 10, 92 3 of 12 this work was aimed at evaluating the performance of RO membranes for the selective removal and concentration of aroma compounds from EC streams, in order to produce aromatic fractions of interest in food, cosmeceutical and pharmaceutical applications. Another interesting perspective of the experimental study is the possibility to produce fresh water as RO permeate, thus allowing one to save water resources. Experimental runs were performed on a laboratory scale by using three diﬀerent polyamide membranes in spiral-wound conﬁguration (SG1812C-34D, SC1812C-34D and SE1812, all from GE Water & Process Technologies), with NaCl rejections in the range 98%–99.5%. The eﬀect of transmembrane pressure, axial feed ﬂowrate and volume concentration ratio on permeate ﬂux was investigated. Rejections of aroma compounds (octanol, α-terpineol, terpinen-4-ol, cis-carveol, karvon, linalool) were evaluated in batch concentration experiments performed in selected operating conditions. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Solutions and Reactants Orange juice EC streams were provided by Gioia Succhi Srl (Rosarno, RC, Italy). Before the RO treatment, condensed streams were ﬁltered through a 200 µm cotton fabric ﬁlter in order to remove foreign materials. Moreover, 2,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-octatriene standard and 85 µm carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane SPME ﬁber were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy). 2.2. Reverse Osmosis Equipment and Procedures Experimental runs were performed by using a RO laboratory bench plant consisting of a control panel, a cylindrical jacketed feed tank (with a capacity of 5L) constructed from stainless steel (SS 316), a feed plunger pump with belt drive (Cat Pumps, Milano-Italy, Model 3CP1221), two pressure gauges (Wika, Lawrenceville, GA, USA) (max pressure 100 bar, absolute error 1 bar), a digital ﬂow meter (SM6000, IFM Electronic GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), a thermometer placed inside the feed tank and a cylindrical housing able to accommodate a 11.74 × 1.75 inches spiral wound membrane module (Figure 1). The adjustment of operating pressure and feed ﬂowrate was done by simultaneously pump rotation control through a frequency inverter and a needle valve. The operating temperature was controlled by circulating either a heating ﬂuid or a coolant through the tank jacket. Figure 1. Schematic representation of reverse osmosis (RO) plant (1—feed tank; 2—cooling shell; 3—discharge tap; 4—feed pump; 5—manometers; 6—membrane module; 7—regulation valve; 8—digital ﬂowmeter; 9—control panel; 10—thermometer; 11—permeate tank; 12—digital balance). Three diﬀerent spiral-wound membranes (SG1812C-34D, SE1812C-34D and SC1812), all supplied by GE Water & Process Technologies (Minnetonka, MN, USA), were tested. All membranes were in polyamide with diﬀerent NaCl rejections (98%, 99% and 99.5%, respectively). Membranes 2020, 10, 92 4 of 12 RO experiments were performed according to both total recycle and batch concentration conﬁguration. In the ﬁrst option, both permeate and retentate streams were recycled back to the feed reservoir with a constant feed volume. This conﬁguration was used to evaluate the eﬀect of the transmembrane pressure (TMP) and feed ﬂowrate (Qf) on the permeate ﬂux. Experiments were performed at an operating temperature of 20 ± 1 ◦C. TMP values were modiﬁed in the range 5–25 bar at a Qf of 360 L/h; the eﬀect of Qf on the permeate ﬂux was investigated in the range 75–825 L/h at ﬁxed values of TMP (5 bar). All tests were conducted for 60 min. Batch concentration experiments were performed by separately collecting the permeate stream and recycling back the retentate in the feed tank in selected operating conditions (TMP, 25 bar; Qf, 360 L/h; temperature, 20 ± 1 ◦C), up to a volume concentration ratio (VCR) of 7.5. VCR is deﬁned according to Equation (1): VCR = Vf Vr = 1 + Vp Vr (1) where Vf, Vr and Vp are the volume of the feed, retentate and permeate solutions, respectively. The volumetric ﬂux of permeate, Jp (L/m2h), was calculated by measuring the permeate volume collected in a certain time, according to the following equation: Jp = Vp A·t (2) where Vp (L) is the permeate volume at time t (h) and A is the membrane eﬀective area (m2). The water permeability of each membrane was obtained as the slope of the straight line resulting from plotting the water ﬂux versus the applied TMP (at 20 ± 1 ◦C and a Qf of 360 L/h). 2.3. Analytical Method Feed, permeate and retentate samples coming from RO experiments were collected and stored at −20 ◦C for further analyses. The concentrations of the aroma compounds were analyzed in the permeate, retentate, and feed streams by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) as a convenient and suitable sample preparation approach, which is widely used in several application ﬁelds [29–32]. SPME was performed using an 85 µm carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane ﬁber, which demonstrated to be a suitable coating for the assay of small volatiles [33]. For the analysis, 2 mL of sample were transferred into a vial and then fortiﬁed at 10 µg/L with 2,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-octatriene (alloocimene), which was used as an internal standard for quantitative analysis. Each vial was crimped with a septum and HS-SPME was carried out by exposing the ﬁber in the headspace volume for 30 min at room temperature. The adsorbed analytes were thermally desorbed by introducing the ﬁber into the GC injector, set at 250 ◦C for 5 min. Thermal blanks of the ﬁber were periodically carried out to verify the potential presence of memory eﬀect. The analyses were carried out in full scan mode using a TSQ Quantum GC (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, USA) system, constituted by a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (QqQ) Quantum and a TRACE GC Ultra equipped with a TriPlus autosampler for fully automated SPME extraction. Chromatographic separation of the analytes was performed using a Restek Rxi-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness, 95% polydimethylsiloxane, 5% polydiphenylsiloxane). The temperature of the GC oven was initially held at 40 ◦C for 3 min, then ramped at 1 ◦C/min to 80 ◦C, ramped again at 20 ◦C/min to 250 ◦C, and held for 2.5 min. The carrier gas was helium ﬂowing at 1 mL/min and the GC injector performed in splitless mode using a Thermo PTV straight Liner 0.75 × 2.75 × 105 mm. The volatile molecules were identiﬁed by comparing the mass spectra with reference spectra from the NIST 02 database (NIST/EPA/NIH Mass Spectral Library, version 2.0, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Membranes 2020, 10, 92 5 of 12 Properties of identiﬁed aroma compounds and their concentrations in the evaporated water of thermally evaporated orange juice are reported in Table 1. Table 1.

All measurements were made in triplicate. Results were expressed as mean value ± SD. The quantitative assay of each compound was performed using the peak area given by the characteristic ionic species, i.e., octanol m/z 56; α-terpineol m/z 59; terpinen-4-ol m/z 71 and 111; cis-carveol m/z 84; karvon m/z 82; linalool m/z 71 and 121; 2,6-dimethyl-2,4,6-octatriene m/z 121. The rejection (R) of RO membranes towards speciﬁc aroma compounds was calculated as follows: R(%) = 1 − Cp C f ·100 (3) where Cp and Cf are the solute concentration in permeate and feed, respectively. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Eﬀect of TMP and Feed Flowrate on Permeate Flux The inﬂuence of TMP on the permeate ﬂux for the investigated membranes in selected operating conditions is shown in Figure 2. Experimental data indicated a linear dependence of pressure inﬂuence on the permeate ﬂux due to minimal concentration polarization and fouling phenomena. Similar results were obtained in the treatment of ethanol, aldehyde and ester solutions at diﬀerent concentration (in the range 0.01%–0.1%) by using composite membranes (high-resistance polyamide supported on polysulphone membranes) [34].

Eﬀect of transmembrane pressure (TMP) on steady-state permeate ﬂux (operating conditions: temperature, 20 ± 1 ◦C; feed ﬂowrate, 360 L/h). In the range of investigated operating pressures, the SG membrane, with the lowest NaCl rejection, exhibited higher permeation ﬂuxes when compared with the other two investigated membranes. This behavior was in agreement with the measurement of pure water ﬂux. Indeed, at an operating temperature of 20 ◦C, the SG membrane showed the highest water permeability (1.94 L/m2hbar), in comparison with the SE (1.46 L/m2hbar) and SC (1.32 L/m2hbar) membranes (Figure 3).

Water ﬂux versus transmembrane pressure for selected RO membranes (operating conditions: temperature, 20 ± 1 ◦C; feed ﬂowrate, 360 L/h). Figure 4 shows the eﬀect of the feed ﬂowrate on the permeate ﬂux at an operating pressure of 5 bar and at 20 ± 1 ◦C. For all the selected membranes, an increase in the feed ﬂowrate in the range of investigated values (100–800 L/h) did not produce any signiﬁcant increase of the permeate ﬂux. This result can be explained assuming that the water ﬂux was not strongly aﬀected by the hydrodynamic conditions of the feed solution, containing a very low concentration of aroma compounds. In these conditions the eﬀect of concentration polarization on permeate ﬂux can be considered negligible. Adversely, a little increase of the permeate ﬂux with feed ﬂowrate was observed by Alvarez et al. [20] in the RO concentration of apple juice model solutions containing a higher concentration of aroma compounds (of the order of 10–200 ppm for each selected aroma compound), with a spiral-wound aromatic polyamide membrane (MSCB 2521 R99, from Separem Spa, Biella, Italy). This behavior was attributed to the reduction of concentration polarization with feed ﬂowrate, because of better mixing in the high-pressure channel.

Eﬀect of feed ﬂowrate on steady-state permeate ﬂux (operating conditions: temperature, 20 ± 1 ◦C; TMP, 5 bar). 3.2. Eﬀect of VCR on Permeate Flux Figure 5 shows the eﬀect of the VCR on the permeate ﬂux at an operating temperature of 20 ± 1 ◦C, an axial feed ﬂowrate of 360 L/h and a TMP of 25 bar. The ﬂux vs. VCR curve can be divided into three steps: a ﬁrst step up to VCR 2 characterized by a rapid decrease of the permeate ﬂux; a second step up to VCR 4 characterized by a slow decline of the permeate ﬂux; a third step characterized by a steady-state permeate ﬂux value. In particular, permeate ﬂuxes decreased of about 22% for SG and SE membranes and 30% for the SC membrane, although during the set-up of the transmembrane pressure, the permeate ﬂuxes increased linearly with pressure for all selected membranes. This behavior can be attributed to the increased concentration of the EC stream in the feed reservoir according to the batch concentration conﬁguration. As the feed concentration increases, the concentration polarization becomes more severe. More solutes are convected towards the membrane surface, resulting in a thicker cake layer, which increases the resistance against the solvent ﬂux [35]. In addition, the increased concentration of solutes increases the osmotic pressure, which at constant TMP causes the ﬂux through the membrane to decrease. These results are in agreement with those reported by Tremblay et al. [28] in the concentration of snow crab cooking eﬄuents with a polyamide RO membrane in spiral-wound conﬁguration, having a 99% NaCl rejection (AG1812C-34D from GE Power, Gloucester, ON, Canada).

In agreement with the data of salt rejection, the SG membrane (NaCl rejection of 98%) exhibited the highest productivity, with a steady-state ﬂux of about 20.8 kg/m2h; for the SE and SC membranes (NaCl rejections of 99% and 99.5%, respectively), the steady-state ﬂuxes were of 16.4 and 12.9 kg/m2h, respectively. Membranes 2020, 10, 92 8 of 12 3.3. Retention of Aroma Compounds In Table 2, the analyses of aromatic compounds in feed and permeate streams of condensed water from thermally evaporated orange juice treated with RO membranes are reported. Data are referred to experimental runs performed in batch concentration at 25 bar, 20 ◦C and an axial feed ﬂowrate of 360 L/h, up to a VCR of 7.5. For all selected membranes, octanol and cis-carveol were not detected in the permeate stream. For other aromatic compounds, the SG membrane showed a lower retention in comparison to the SE and SC membranes, according to its lower NaCl rejection (98%). In particular, for both SE and SC membranes, the rejection towards aroma compounds was higher than 95% (Figure 6). In general, the retention of aroma compounds can be reasonably well explained by the polar, steric and nonpolar eﬀects of the solute molecules. In particular, it is well known that the recovery of aroma compounds in the retentate of RO membranes is strongly aﬀected by the molecular mass [36]. In our case, the observed rejection with RO membranes are of the same order of magnitude, considering that the molecular mass and the polarity of the analysed aromas are very similar. Table 2.

High retention values (>80%) were also observed by Alvarez et al. [20] and Schutte [37] for alcoholic aroma compounds (butanol, hexanol, isopentanol, isobutanol) in the concentration of model solutions with aromatic polyamide RO membranes. The proﬁle of concentration factor for all investigated aroma compounds as a function of VCR is reported in Figure 7. Experimental results indicated for the SC membrane the best correlation coeﬃcient (more than 0.99), between concentration factor of aroma compounds and VCR; in particular, for all investigated compounds an increase of their concentration up to 6.7–6.9 fold in comparison with the feed solution was detected at a VCR of 7.5. For SG and SE membranes, the concentration of Membranes 2020, 10, 92 9 of 12 aroma compounds at VCR 7.5 resulted in being 4 to 5.5-fold higher than the feed solution, indicating a partial loss of these compounds during the process. This phenomenon can be partially attributed to their permeation through the membrane (SG and SE membranes exhibited a lower retention towards most of the analyzed compounds in comparison to the SC membrane), although interactions with the membrane material (membrane adsorption) cannot be excluded. In addition, for all selected membranes, loss of aroma compounds from the retentate due to volatilization appeared to be signiﬁcant, starting from a VCR 4, due to the increased time of processing.

Proﬁle of concentration factor with volume concentration ratio (VCR) for: (a) octanol; (b) linalool; (c) terpinen-4-ol; (d) α-terpineol; (e) cis-carveol; (f) karvon. These results are in agreement with those observed by Pozderovi´c et al. [36] in the concentration of alcohol model solutions with RO composite membranes (HR 95 PP and HR 98 PP from Dow Denmark Separation Systems, Copenhagen, Denmark). Authors observed that the decreasing processing time resulted in a lower loss of aroma compounds from the retentate, due to volatilization and membrane adsorption. Membranes 2020, 10, 92 10 of 12 The whole results indicate that the SC membrane is the most suitable membrane to recover and concentrate aroma compounds from EC streams produced in the concentration of orange juice. The concentrated solution could be of interest for food applications (i.e., aroma compounds for food and beverages), as well as for the formulation of functional foods or cosmeceutical products. On the other hand, the puriﬁed water stream (permeate) can be reused in the orange juice production as process water (cleaning of fruits and plants, cleaning of membranes, irrigation, etc.), with additional advantages in terms of water saving and the reduction of environmental pollution. 4. Conclusions The recovery and concentration of aroma compounds from evaporated water produced in the thermal concentration of orange juice was investigated through the use of reverse osmosis membranes in spiral-wound conﬁgurations with diﬀerent NaCl rejections. For all selected membranes, the permeate ﬂux was observed to increase with the transmembrane pressure, in the range of investigated operating values (5–25 bar). On the other hand, an increase in the feed ﬂowrate in the range of 100–800 L/h did not produce any signiﬁcant increase of the permeate ﬂux. In agreement with the data of salt rejection, the SG membrane (NaCl rejection 98%) exhibited the highest productivity (steady-state ﬂux of about 20.8 kg/m2h) in batch concentration experiments performed in selected operating conditions, up to a volume concentration ratio of 7.5. However, by referring to the membrane selectivity, the SC membrane (NaCl rejection 99.5%) showed the highest retention of aroma compounds (higher than 96%) with the total rejection of octanol, cis-carveol and karvon. This membrane also showed the best correlation between the concentration factor of aroma compounds and VCR. The results of this study would lay the experimental basis for a potential exploitation of the orange juice evaporator condensate streams, through the production of concentrated aroma solutions of interest in food applications or as functional ingredients (i.e., drinks of nutritional water enriched with orange aroma). They also provide a useful approach for producing fresh water to be reused for diﬀerent purposes, thus saving water resources.

Introduction Energy shortage and environmental pollution have become two major problems restricting the sustainable development of human beings. Due to overexploitation, traditional fossil fuels have been nearly exhausted, and the worldwide competition for resources is on the rise. In addition, the exploitation of fossil fuels damages land and villages and pollutes water resources, and the various gases and solid wastes produced in the process of using fossil fuels also pollute the environment. Developing clean energy to replace fossil fuel is an eﬀective way to solve the environmental and energy problems, so it has gradually become the focus of people’s attention and the key development ﬁeld of various countries [1–3]. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a kind of biological reaction device that uses microbial metabolism to convert chemical energy in organic matter into electrical energy directly. An MFC uses organic waste as fuel to generate electric energy in the process of waste treatment, and almost no harmful substances are produced in the process of electricity generation. It can be used not only as a power generation device to solve energy problems but also as a waste disposal device to solve environmental pollution problems. Therefore, it is regarded as an eﬃcient, low-consumption, clean, and environmentally sustainable energy [4–6]. Membranes 2020, 10, 185; doi:10.3390/membranes10080185 www.mdpi.com/journal/membranes Membranes 2020, 10, 185 2 of 14 Due to the inﬂuence of low power generation, high cost, and unstable work, the popularization and application of MFCs is still restricted [7]. The main factors aﬀecting the performance of MFCs include microbial population, exchange membrane, electrode, internal and external resistance, substrate concentration, electrode spacing, etc. [8–11]. Researchers have tried various methods to improve the performance of MFCs. The common methods include the fabrication of new electrode materials, the development of a more eﬃcient exchange membrane, the modiﬁcation of carbon-based electrode materials and Naﬁon membrane, the cultivation of more eﬃcient electrogenic bacteria, and so on. When a potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7)-modiﬁed carbon cloth anode was used in an MFC, the power generation performance and wastewater treatment eﬀects were signiﬁcantly improved [12]. Au-g-C3N4 nanostructures have high electron transfer eﬃciency and can be used as MFC electrodes to improve electrochemical performance [13]. Ag@g-C3N4 NSs, which was fabricated by an innovative and simple biogenic approach, can produce highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) [14], if it is used as the cathode or catalyst of MFCs, the reaction rate of the cathode chamber can be accelerated. The MFCs using a Mo2C/CCT (molybdenum carbide nanoparticles-modiﬁed carbonized cotton textile) anode can produce higher power density [15]. Some research found that the use of mutualistic interaction of yeast and bacteria could increase the performance of the MFCs [16]. Among all these factors that aﬀect MFC performance, the proton exchange membrane is considered to be the most important factor aﬀecting the operation eﬀect of MFC. A proton exchange membrane is an important part to separate the anode chamber and cathode chamber and transfer protons from anode to cathode; moreover, the cost of the membrane accounts for more than 38% of the total cost of MFCs [17,18], so it is also one of the important factor aﬀecting the promotion and application of MFCs. Proton exchange membranes have been widely used in MFCs because of their advantages of high conductivity and low internal resistance [19–21]. The most commonly used proton exchange membrane in MFCs is perﬂuorosulfonic acid membrane, such as a Naﬁon membrane produced by the DuPont Company. The main advantages of Naﬁon membranes are their high proton conductivity, good chemical stability, and mechanical properties, but it still has some drawbacks such as high oxygen permeability, poor thermal stability, biological deposition, and serious water loss at high temperature, which limits the performance of MFCs [22]. In order to solve these problems, it is an eﬀective and recognized way to improve the performance of MFCs by membrane modiﬁcation. Polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) is a pure thermoplastic ﬂuoropolymer. PVDF not only has the advantages of good toughness, low friction coeﬃcient, corrosion-resistant, and anti-aging but also has the characteristics of low density, low impedance, and good chemical stability [23–27]. On the other hand, compared with a Naﬁon membrane itself, PVDF is a relatively cheap material. Modifying a Naﬁon membrane by PVDF can improve the water retention and its adaptability to temperature and humidity at a very low cost [28] and then increase the electricity-generating capacity and the wastewater treatment eﬃciency of MFCs, so the overall cost performance of an MFC system is improved. In this paper, PVDF particles and a kind of modiﬁed PVDF solution were used to modify the proton exchange membrane, and the eﬀects of PVDF and modiﬁed PVDF on the power generation performance and water puriﬁcation eﬀect of MFCs were studied. In addition, a group of experiments was added to study the eﬀect of carbon cloth and carbon felt electrodes on the operation of MFCs under the same other conditions. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Composition of the Experimental System The experimental system consists of three parts, namely, a dual chamber MFC, an external load and a data acquisition system (Figure 1). A dual chamber MFC is mainly composed of a cathode chamber, anode chamber, proton exchange membrane, cathode, and anode. The reaction chambers were made of plexiglass. The cathode chamber and anode chamber are separated by a proton exchange membrane (Naﬁon 117; DuPont Co., Wilmington, DE, USA). The volume of both the cathode and Membranes 2020, 10, 185 3 of 14 anode reaction chambers was 500 mL. Both the anode and cathode materials were carbon felt with surface areas of 4 cm × 4.5 cm. The anode and the cathode were connected with external load through wires to form a complete closed circuit. The voltage generated by the MFC was collected through the data acquisition card (MPS-010602; Morpheus Electronics Technology Co., Beijing, China), recorded every 60 s, and transmitted to a computer through USB interface for storage, processing, and display. Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the MFC experiment system. 2.2. Experimental Materials and Pretreatment The anolyte of the MFC for experiment was molasses wastewater, which was prepared by mixing the following chemicals: 3.13 g/L NaHCO3, 0.31 g/L NH4Cl, 6.338 g/L NaH2PO4·H2O, 0.13 g/L KCl, 0.2 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 0.015 g/L CaCl2, 3 g/L brown sugar, 0.01 g/L MnSO4·H2O, and 6.8556 g/L Na2HPO4·12H2O. The catholyte used in the experiment was a mixture of potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]) and sodium chloride (NaCl). 0.2 mol/L K3[Fe(CN)6] (32.9 g) was dissolved in a phosphoric acid buﬀer solution (PBS) in a 500 mL volumetric ﬂask; we put 0.4 mol/L NaCl (11.7 g) into another 500 mL volumetric ﬂask; then the K3[Fe(CN)6] solution described above were mixed with NaCl solution in a ratio of 1:1 to obtain the catholyte of the MFC. All the reagents used in the experiment were purchased from Damao Co, Tianjin, China. Many research results show that soil is rich in microorganisms [29,30]. So the electrogenic bacteria used in the anode chamber were obtained by culturing some soil. The soil was collected around some trees in the campus. Under anaerobic conditions, the prepared simulated molasses wastewater and the collected soil were put into the culture ﬂask together, then some trace elements (such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc.) needed for microbial growth were added, and then the culture ﬂask was put into the biochemical incubator and domesticated at 30 ◦C for about 3 days. When the sludge in the culture ﬂask was suspended as ﬂocculate, the culture of microorganisms was considered to be successful. 2.3. Preparation of Membranes We boiled the proton exchange membrane (Naﬁon 117) in 5% H2O2 solution for 1 h, then took it out and washed it repeatedly with deionized water to remove organic impurities; then boiled it in 1 mol/L H2SO4 for 1 h to remove metal ion impurities; we then took it out and washed it repeatedly with deionized water again and boiled it for 1 h with deionized water to remove the residual H2SO4. The pretreated proton exchange membrane was put into deionized water for standby. Membranes 2020, 10, 185 4 of 14 (1) Preparation of PVDF and modiﬁed PVDF solution DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide) is a widely used excellent organic solvent with good solubility and chemical stability for a variety of organic and inorganic compounds [31]. Therefore, we used DMF as solvent to make the PVDF solution. 12.47 g PVDF was dissolved in 250 mL DMF solution and stirred for 2 h at room temperature to obtain white PVDF solution. 11.21 g PVDF was dissolved in 250 mL mixture of DMF and acetone with a volume ratio of 4:6 and stirred continuously for 2 h at room temperature, and then the modiﬁed PVDF solution with milky white color was obtained. (2) Preparation of composite membrane The Naﬁon membrane with a size of 10 cm × 10 cm was immersed in a methanol solution with a volume ratio of 3:1 for 1 h to make the membrane surface swell, and thus the PVDF particles can better adhere to it; then the Naﬁon membrane was placed in the PVDF solution and soaked at a constant temperature of 60 ◦C for 5 min; then it was taken out and dried and placed in a vacuum drying oven to dry at a constant temperature of 60 ◦C for 15 min. Repeating the above operations for four or ﬁve times, PVDF–Naﬁon composite membrane was obtained. We immersed another Naﬁon membrane in the modiﬁed PVDF solution, treated the Naﬁon membrane in the same way as above, and ﬁnally, the modiﬁed PVDF–Naﬁon composite membrane was prepared [32]. 2.4. Analysis Method The performance analysis of an MFC mainly includes power generation performance and wastewater treatment eﬀect. The current density value is generally used to evaluate the power generation performance. The output current I of the MFC can be calculated by Ohm’s law according to the measured voltage value U, that is: I = U/R (1) in which U is the output voltage of the MFC measured by data acquisition card and R is the external load resistance. In the experiment, R is always set at 500 Ω. Then the generating current density IA of the MFC can be obtained by calculating the following formula: IA = I A = U AR (2) where A is the anode surface area of the fuel cell. Wastewater treatment eﬀect is also an important index of MFC performance. In MFCs, microorganisms degrade organics to generate electricity; meanwhile, the wastewater that is used as an anolyte (or fuel) of the MFC can also be puriﬁed well. In order to analyze the wastewater treatment eﬀect of the MFC, the inﬂuent COD and eﬄuent COD of the anode chamber were measured by a LH-NP2 type COD rapid detector (Lohand biological company, Dalian, China), and then the COD removal rate of the MFC was calculated, according to which the wastewater treatment eﬀect of the MFC was analyzed subsequently. Through the physical structure and morphology of the material, the eﬀect of the membrane modiﬁcation can be analyzed more deeply in essence. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JSM-6360LV; JEOL Co., Tokyo, Japan) analysis of the exchange membrane before and after modiﬁcation was carried out and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (CHI660E, CH Instrument Co., Shanghai, China) analysis of the MFC was also provided in this experiment. Membranes 2020, 10, 185 5 of 14 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Comparison of Power Generation Performance Four MFC experimental systems with the same basic conﬁguration were run simultaneously to guarantee that the other experimental conditions are the same except for the comparison items, so as to obtain a good comparison eﬀect. Firstly, the inﬂuence of diﬀerent electrodes on the power generation performance of the MFC with the same Naﬁon membrane was analyzed. Figure 2 shows the output voltage curves of MFCs with diﬀerent electrodes and diﬀerent exchange membranes. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that the power generation capacity of MFC with carbon cloth electrode was obviously diﬀerent from that of the MFC with a carbon felt electrode. When both the exchange membranes of the MFCs are common Naﬁon membranes, the steady-state output voltage of the MFC with a carbon cloth electrode was about 0.025 V, while the steady-state output voltage of the MFC with a carbon felt electrode was about 0.107 V. That is to say, the output voltage of the MFC with a carbon felt electrode is about 328% higher than that of MFC with a carbon cloth electrode. This is mainly due to the fact that the carbon felt has a larger speciﬁc surface area and richer and ﬁner pores than the carbon cloth. Therefore, it is more beneﬁcial for microorganisms to be adhered to its surface and, thus, increases the growth space of the anode bioﬁlm and improves the electron transfer of the whole system. In view of the above experimental results, carbon felt was used as the electrode of the MFC in the later experiments. It can also be seen from Figure 2 that the output voltage of the MFC with a PVDF-modiﬁed Naﬁon membrane was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the MFC with a common Naﬁon membrane. This is mainly because the exchange membrane modiﬁed by PVDF improves the water retention performance, so the water absorption capacity and proton conductivity are improved. The introduction of organic materials is also eﬀective to improve the conductivity of the exchange membrane. However, when the exchange membrane was modiﬁed by general PVDF, although the output voltage was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the MFC with a normal Naﬁon membrane, the output voltage ﬂuctuated so much that it was diﬃcult to stabilize. Although the maximum voltage can reach 0.3 V, the output voltage cannot be kept at a high value stably and drops sharply after reaching the peak value; in the early stage of its operation, the start-up voltage of the MFC is relatively low. Low starting voltage and ﬂuctuating output are major problems aﬀecting practical application. Therefore, the improved PVDF was used to modify the membrane to further improve the power generation stability of the MFC. The stability of the output voltage of the MFC with a modiﬁed PVDF–Naﬁon composite membrane was improved obviously; in this case, the steady state output voltage was about 0.21 V, which was 96.3% higher than that of the MFC with a common Naﬁon membrane. 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 Voltage U/V t (h) Nafion/carbon felt PVDF-Nafion/carbon felt modified PVDF-Nafion/carbon felt Nafion/carbon cloth Figure 2. Output voltage curves of MFCs under diﬀerent conditions. Membranes 2020, 10, 185 6 of 14 The stability of the output voltage of the MFC with a modiﬁed PVDF–Naﬁon membrane has been improved signiﬁcantly, mainly because the acetone solvent accelerated the rate of acceptance of PVDF by the Naﬁon membrane; in addition, the porous and disordered structure on the surface of the Naﬁon membrane makes PVDF easier to adhere to, making the proton transmission performance of the modiﬁed Naﬁon membrane more stable, thus improving the stability of the output electric energy of the MFC. In order to compare the power generation capacity of MFCs in the several diﬀerent conditions more eﬀectively, the output electrical energy values of the MFC with four diﬀerent conditions were calculated and compared. The formula that links energy W and power P is: W = Pt (3) The power can be calculated by using the Joule’s law equation, so the energy can be described by: W = UIt = U2 R t (4) Since the output voltage of the MFC is time-varying, the output electrical energy within 0 h to 150 h can be expressed as: W = 150 0 u2 R dt (5) Figure 3 shows the electrical energy values generated by the four MFCs with diﬀerent conditions. It can be seen that the MFC with a carbon cloth electrode produced much less electrical energy than the MFC with a carbon felt electrode. The output electrical energy of the MFC with the common Naﬁon membrane and carbon cloth electrode was 3.83 J. When a carbon felt electrode was used, the electrical energy generated by the MFCs using the common Naﬁon membrane, the PVDF–Naﬁon composite membrane, and the modiﬁed PVDF–Naﬁon membrane were 29.7 J, 45.3 J, and 47.4 J, respectively. The electrical energy produced by the MFC with the common Naﬁon membrane was signiﬁcantly lower than that of the MFC with the two composite membranes. This shows that the PVDF-modiﬁed proton exchange membrane signiﬁcantly enhances the power generation capacity of MFCs. The electrical energy of the MFC with modiﬁed PVDF membrane was slightly higher than that of the MFC with a general PVDF-modiﬁed membrane. This shows that the use of the modiﬁed PVDF membrane can not only signiﬁcantly enhance the power generation stability of the MFC but also improves the power generation performance of MFC. Therefore, modiﬁcation of the exchange membrane by modiﬁed PVDF has a good eﬀect on improving the overall performance of the MFC. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Electric Energy W/J Nafion/carbon cloth Nafion/carbon felt PVDF/Nafion/carbon felt modified PVDF/Nafion/carbon felt Figure 3. Electrical energy of MFCs with diﬀerent conditions. In order to further analyze the eﬀect of the modiﬁed PVDF on the stability of the MFC, the standard deviation of the output current density of the MFC was calculated. Membranes 2020, 10, 185 7 of 14 The steady-state value of the current density that characterizes the power supply capacity of the MFC can be obtained according to the calculation formula of the average value: µ = X1 + X2 + . . . + Xn n (6) where µ is the average value of current density (A/m2); Xi is the value of current density of the ith sample (A/m2); n is the number of samples. The power supply stability of the MFC can be characterized by standard deviation, i.e., σ = 1 n n i=1(Xi −µ)2 (7) where σ is the standard deviation of the output current density (A/m2). Standard deviation is a measure of the degree of dispersion of the average of a set of data. A larger standard deviation means that there is a larger diﬀerence between the sample data and its average value, while a smaller standard deviation means that the sample data is closer to the average value. The smaller the standard deviation, the smaller the volatility and the better the stability [33,34]. Figure 4 shows the current density curves of the MFC in diﬀerent conditions. It can be seen that the steady-state values of the current density of the MFC with the PVDF–Naﬁon composite membrane and the modiﬁed PVDF–Naﬁon membrane were 0.219 A/m2 and 0.233 A/m2, respectively. Although there was only little diﬀerence between the two, it can be seen from Table 1 that the standard deviation values of the current density of the MFC with the PVDF composite membrane and the MFC with the modiﬁed PVDF composite membrane were 0.062 A/m2 and 0.013 A/m2, respectively, and the standard deviation of the current density of the MFC with the modiﬁed PVDF composite membrane was signiﬁcantly lower than that of the MFC with the common PVDF composite membrane. This means that the modiﬁed PVDF membrane signiﬁcantly improves the stability of the output power of the MFC. The modiﬁed PVDF membrane can eﬀectively overcome the serious ﬂuctuation of the output electrical energy of the MFC caused by the conventional PVDF-modiﬁed membrane, which not only increases the output voltage of the MFC, but also improves the stability of its output electrical energy. This is of great signiﬁcance for the practical application of MFCs. 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 IA (A/m 2) t (h) Nafion/carbon felt PVDF Nafion/carbon felt modified PVDF Nafion/carbon felt Nafion/carbon cloth Figure 4.

SEM Analysis The SEM images of the three diﬀerent proton exchange membranes are shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that the surface of the conventional Naﬁon membrane had no obvious morphological characteristics except for some sporadic impurities, and it seems to be a compact plane shape as a whole. The surface morphology of the PVDF-modiﬁed proton exchange membrane was rough and mossy, and there were many granular and agglomerated substances protruding from the surface, which should be due to the uneven distribution of the modiﬁer. Moreover, the white PVDF particles on the surface of the membrane were sparse and uneven, which may be the main reason for the instability of the power generation performance. However, the surface of the acetone-modiﬁed PVDF–Naﬁon composite membrane was covered by many regular granular polymers, and more pores were formed, which is more conducive to proton conduction. From the overall point of view of the composite membrane, the distribution of PVDF white particles was dense and uniform, indicating that PVDF particles were well attached to Naﬁon membrane, thus improving the power production and output stability of MFCs. This indicates that the modiﬁed PVDF can bring a better modiﬁcation eﬀect on the proton exchange membrane than ordinary PVDF. (a) (b) (c) Figure 5. SEM images. (a) general Naﬁon membrane.

Hydroscopicity Analysis of Membrane The water absorption performance of the proton exchange membrane is directly related to the power generation performance of MFC. When the water content of the membrane is high, the migration coeﬃcient of the proton is higher than that of water, and the conductivity is also high. Therefore, the higher the water absorption of the membrane, the better its conductivity. To compare the hydroscopicity of the three diﬀerent membranes used in the experiment, the water absorption of the three membranes was calculated, respectively, by measuring the weight of the membrane before and after hydration [35,36]. Firstly, the membrane was immersed in deionized water at room temperature for 24 h. Then the membrane surface was dried with the ﬁlter paper immediately after taking it out, and then was weighed and marked as wet weight of the membrane W1. The membrane was then placed in an oven Membranes 2020, 10, 185 9 of 14 at 80 ◦C and baked for 4 h and, then, was taken out and cooled to room temperature, weighed, and recorded as dry weight W0. Then the water absorption of the membrane can be calculated as: ∆W(%) = W1 −W0 W0 × 100% (8) The water absorption rates of the three diﬀerent membranes are shown in Table 2. Table 2. Water absorption rate of diﬀerent membranes. Naﬁon/Carbon Felt PVDF–Naﬁon/ Carbon Felt Modiﬁed PVDF– Naﬁon/Carbon Felt Wet weight W1 (g) 3.65 3.92 3.87 Dry weight W0 (g) 3.43 3.50 3.46 Water absorption rate ∆W (%) 6.41 12.00 11.80 It can be seen from Table 2 that the water absorption rate of the PVDF membrane was 12%, while that of the modiﬁed PVDF membrane was 11.8%, which was 87.2% and 84.1% higher than that of the conventional Naﬁon membrane, respectively. The water absorption rate of the modiﬁed PVDF composite membrane was basically the same as that of the PVDF membrane. This shows that the conductivity of the two kinds of PVDF-modiﬁed membranes was approximately the same, which further proves the above experimental results. 3.4. Analysis of EIS EIS can reﬂect the dynamic process, mechanism, and impedance information of the whole MFC system. The internal resistance and its own reaction kinetics process are also important factors aﬀecting the operation eﬀect of the MFC. The Nyquist plots of the four MFCs under diﬀerent operating conditions are shown in Figure 6. Each curve is composed of two parts, namely, the semicircle in the high frequency region and the straight line in the low frequency region. The value of the left intersection of the semicircle and the horizontal axis is the solution internal resistance Rs; the diameter of the semicircle is the charge transfer impedance Rct caused by redox reaction on the electrode surface. The straight line in the low frequency region represents the Warburg impedance, which reﬂects the diﬀusion degree of ions in the electrode [37–39]. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 Nafion/carbon felt PVDF Nafion/carbon felt modified PVDF Nafion/carbon felt Nafion/carbon cloth -Z'' (Ω) Z' (Ω) Figure 6. Electrochemical impedance spectra of MFCs under diﬀerent conditions. It can be seen from Figure 6 that the charge transfer impedance Rct of the MFC with conventional Naﬁon membrane and carbon felt anode is about 10 Ω, which is signiﬁcantly greater than that of PVDF–Naﬁon membrane and modiﬁed PVDF–Naﬁon membrane. The test results show that the MFC Membranes 2020, 10, 185 10 of 14 with the conventional Naﬁon membrane has a large polarization internal resistance, while the MFC constructed by the PVDF-modiﬁed proton exchange membrane reduces the polarization internal resistance. This may be due to the improvement of proton transfer eﬃciency and electrochemical reaction eﬃciency of the whole system by PVDF-modiﬁed proton exchange membrane, thus reducing the polarization internal resistance. At the same time, it also can be seen that the solution internal resistance Rs of MFC with the ordinary PVDF–Naﬁon membrane and the MFC with the modiﬁed PVDF–Naﬁon membrane were about 6.5 Ωand 2.6 Ω, respectively. Compared with the general PVDF-modiﬁed membrane, the modiﬁed PVDF membrane can make the MFCs have a lower solution resistance. Therefore, the modiﬁed PVDF is a more suitable modiﬁer for improving the performance of proton exchange membranes. What is more, it can also be seen from the comparative experimental results that the solution internal impedance of the MFC with the carbon cloth electrode was almost the same as that of the MFC with the carbon felt electrode, but the charge transfer impedance was quite diﬀerent. The charge transfer impedance of the MFC with the carbon cloth electrode was about 30 Ω, which was about three times that of the MFC with the carbon felt electrode. This further indicates that carbon felt is more suitable for use as an electrode of MFCs than carbon cloth. To obtain more detailed impedance information, the impedance data were ﬁtted in Zview (Scribner Associates Inc., Southern Pines, NC, USA). The equivalent circuit is shown in Figure 7, where Zw is the Warburg impedance reﬂecting the resistance encountered by the reactants in the process of diﬀusion in solution; CPE is a constant phase element in which the double layer impedance is represented. CPE Zw Rct Rs Figure 7. The equivalent circuit of MFCs under diﬀerent conditions. The impedance data obtained by equivalent circuit ﬁtting are listed in Table 3. It can be seen that the Warburg impedance changed little in several diﬀerent cases, but the solution impedance of acetone-modiﬁed PVDF composite membrane was the smallest. Table 3.

Water Quality Analysis When molasses wastewater was used as an anolyte of the MFC, the COD values of inﬂuent and eﬄuent of MFCs with diﬀerent proton exchange membranes are shown in Table 4. It can be seen that the COD removal rate of the MFC with conventional Naﬁon membrane was 38.1%, while the COD removal rates of the MFC with the PVDF–Naﬁon composite membrane and the MFC with the modiﬁed PVDF–Naﬁon composite membrane were 63% and 66.7%, respectively, which were 65.4% and 75.1% higher than that of MFC with ordinary Naﬁon membrane. Therefore, when the molasses wastewater was used as the fuel of MFC, the molasses wastewater had also been well puriﬁed and treated while the organic matter was degraded by the microorganisms, and the use of the modiﬁed Membranes 2020, 10, 185 11 of 14 PVDF membrane further improved the water puriﬁcation eﬀect of the MFC. This indicates that MFCs can not only degrade organic matter to produce electric energy but also purify the wastewater as feed. In particular, when the proton exchange membrane was loaded by the modiﬁed PVDF, the puriﬁcation eﬀect of the MFC was signiﬁcantly improved. Molasses wastewater is a kind of wastewater with high pollutant concentration, which is rich in sugars, proteins, amino acids, vitamins, and other organic matter. Molasses wastewater, which has high concentrations of COD and complex components, could cause serious environmental pollution in the ecosystem [40]. At present, the COD removal rate of the existing molasses wastewater treatment methods is generally not very high. For example, the COD removal rate of molasses wastewater by UV photolysis method was only 2%; the COD removal rate of a complex hybrid system was only about 15% [41,42], and the COD removal rate of molasses wastewater by anaerobic tank with better treatment eﬀect was about 46.0% [43]. Therefore, it is an alternative method to use MFCs to treat molasses wastewater. Most importantly, MFCs can generate electric energy while treating wastewater, which provides an eﬀective way to solve the dual pressure of environmental pollution and energy crisis at the same time. So, MFCs are a promising technology for power generation and wastewater treatment. Table 4. Inﬂuent and eﬄuent COD of MFCs with diﬀerent membranes (with carbon felt electrode).

Conclusions Using PVDF particles to modify the Naﬁon membrane can improve the power generation performance and water puriﬁcation eﬀect of the MFC eﬀectively. The membrane modiﬁed by the modiﬁed PVDF solution can further improve the adhesion of PVDF on the membrane and, thus, improve the power generation stability of the MFC. When the modiﬁed PVDF–Naﬁon composite membrane was used, the performance of MFC in power generation capacity, power supply stability, sewage treatment eﬀect, and other aspects were signiﬁcantly improved. In this case, the output voltage of MFC can be basically stable at 0.21 V in most of the running time, which was 96.3% higher than that of the MFC with the conventional Naﬁon membrane; the COD removal rate of molasses wastewater can reach 66.7%, which is 75.1% higher than that of the MFC with the ordinary Naﬁon membrane. Therefore, PVDF is a valuable membrane modiﬁcation material, which can improve the performance of MFCs. In addition, although the water puriﬁcation eﬀect of the MFC with the carbon felt electrode is almost the same as the MFC with the carbon cloth electrode, the electricity production capacity of the MFC with the carbon felt electrode is much higher than that of the MFC with the carbon cloth electrode. Therefore, carbon felt is a better electrode for the MFC than the carbon cloth.

Introduction The existence and subsequent discovery of chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) in aquatic environments has sparked interest in determining removal capabilities of speciﬁc water treatment technologies. Nanoﬁltration (NF) is a promising pressure-driven semipermeable membrane technology that can be employed to remove CECs from aqueous streams [1–5]. In a membrane process, the extent of solute removal is dependent on chemical properties, feed water matrix composition, membrane characteristics, and operational variables [1,2,6–8]. A strong research eﬀort has attempted to elucidate the impact of CEC properties on solute removal through NF processes. It is widely accepted that molecular weight is an important parameter in the prediction of non-charged and non-polar compound rejection [1,9–11]. However, other solute characteristics such as chemical properties, solute geometry, and functional groups can also aﬀect rejection of CECs [1,6,7]. In a membrane process, correlations between CEC removal and hydrophobicity [12], membrane adsorption [13], polarizability [14], polarity [15,16], and molecular size and shape [6,7,14,17,18] have been noted. The complexities of CEC mass transfer have been scrutinized and reported on over the years and serve as the basis for additional investigations such as those presented herein. The position of functional groups in structural isomers has also been shown to have signiﬁcant eﬀects on rejection by reverse osmosis membranes [19]. This suggests that the spatial arrangement of atoms plays a larger role in membrane process removal than currently understood. A solute property that has received little attention regarding behavior in a membrane process is chirality. Chiral molecules, or stereoisomers, are molecules with the same molecular formula and chemical Membranes 2020, 10, 383; doi:10.3390/membranes10120383 www.mdpi.com/journal/membranes Membranes 2020, 10, 383 2 of 13 bonding arrangement, but dissimilar spatial position of atoms. Enantiomers are pairs of stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images. Although enantiomers have the same molecular formula and other chemical properties, some are known to behave diﬀerently. A well-known example of a chiral molecule is ibuprofen (IBU). IBU is a weak propionic acid derivative and pharmaceutically active compound (PhAC) known for its non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory (NSAID) properties. The molecule contains a chiral carbon, yielding two enantiomers, S-IBU and R-IBU. Although medically administered IBU is a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers, the S-form possesses most of the anti-inﬂammatory properties [20–22]. Physiochemical properties of IBU such as low Henry’s law constant (1.5 × 10−7 atm-m3/mol), moderately high log octanol-water partition constant (Kow; 3.97), and soil adsorption constant (log Koc; 2.60) suggest that the PhAC often persists in aquatic environments and can display adsorptive qualities to clay and other loamy solids [23]. Like other CECs, IBU has been detected in groundwater and surface waters from the ng/L to µg/L level [24,25]. The enantiomeric ratio (ER) of IBU in surface water has been recorded higher than 0.5, yielding disproportionate enantiomer concentrations in favor of the S-counterpart [26]. In this presented work, the capability of NF process to remove enantiomeric IBU (S-IBU, R-IBU) at acidic pH conditions is explored. The behavior of chirality with respect to removal by nanoﬁltration membranes has not been fully vetted. The results of this research provide insight into the diﬀering behavior of chiral molecules, further elucidating the eﬀect of solute properties on membrane rejection. 2. Materials and Methods In this study, Dupont Filmtec NF270 (Edina, MN, USA) and Microdyn Nadir Trisep TS40 (Goleta, CA, USA) membranes were assessed. The polyamide thin-ﬁlm composite NF270 and polypiperazine amide TS40 were acquired from Sterlitech Corp. (Kent, WA, USA). Membranes were received as ﬂat sheets, cut to the appropriate size, and soaked in deionized water (DI) for at least 24 h prior to experimentation. Membrane operational parameters are listed in Table 1. Racemic IBU was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) with reported purity of greater than 99%. A 400 mg/L standard solution was prepared in LC/MS grade methanol and sonicated for homogeneity. The standard was stored at 4 ◦C in a salinized amber bottle and used within one month. Table 1.

Experimental Setup A bench-scale, ﬂat-sheet membrane testing apparatus was used in this research. The unit consisted of a Wanner Engineering M-03S Hydra-Cell 6.81 L/min pump (Minneapolis, MN, USA) with a Control Techniques variable frequency drive (VFD) (Eden Prairie, MN, USA), a 19 L Sterlitech stainless steel conical feed tank, two Sterlitech CF042 acrylic cells to house the membrane coupons (operated in parallel for duplicity) with 42 cm2 eﬀective membrane area, and accompanying appurtenances consisting of ﬂowmeters, pressure gauges, check valves, and stainless steel braided hose. Two MyWeigh CTS-600 scales (Phoenix, AZ, USA) were utilized for permeate collection and ﬂux measurements. Feed ﬂow was controlled with the VFD and set at 1.0 L/min, corresponding to a crossﬂow velocity of 0.18 m/s. Feed pressure was controlled by the concentrate control valve. A chiller-coil system was utilized to sustain a feed water temperature of 20 ± 1 ◦C. Prior to each experiment, membrane coupons were inserted into the bench-scale, ﬂat-sheet unit and compacted at 6.9 bar (100 psi) with DI water for at least 24 h. After initial compaction, the mixture was replaced with a 10 L solution containing DI water spiked with racemic IBU and Membranes 2020, 10, 383 3 of 13 adjusted to acidic conditions (feed water pH of 4.0 to 6.0 units) with 1 M sodium hydroxide or 5.8 M hydrochloric acid. Then, the bench-scale, ﬂat-sheet unit was repressured with the experimental feed water matrix and operated for 24 h. Experiments were conducted in recycle mode, where permeate and concentrate streams recycled back to the feed reservoir. Feed water samples were taken at 0 and 24 h, where permeate and concentrate aliquots were taken at 24 h. The unit was ﬂushed at least twice with 5 L of DI water in between experiments. A new set of membrane coupons was used for each experiment. 2.2. Analytical Methods Samples were collected in 150 mL salinized amber bottles, stored in a 4 ◦C refrigerator, and extracted and analyzed within 48 h and 7 d, respectively. A solid phase extraction (SPE) method was utilized to extract and preconcentrate R- and S-IBU enantiomers [27]. Extractions were performed utilizing a Waters vacuum manifold and Waters Oasis HLB 3 mL, 60 mg cartridges (Milford, MA, USA). The R- and S-IBU enantiomers were analyzed via a Perkin-Elmer Series 200 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrument (Santa Clara, CA, USA). Separations were carried out on a Chiral Technologies, Inc., (West Chester, PA, USA) Chiralcel OJ-H column (4.6 × 150 mm, i.d., 5 µm particle size). The column was operated in polar phase mode, with an isocratic mobile phase consisting of methanol/formic acid (100:0.1, v/v) at a ﬂow rate of 1 mL/min. A ramé-hart Model 100 goniometer (Succasunna, NJ, USA) was utilized to determine membrane hydrophobicity via contact angle. Contact angle measurements were attained utilizing the sessile drop technique. Membrane coupons were dried and inserted on the stage with the active layer facing up. A micrometer syringe delivered a droplet of DI water onto the membrane surface, and a contact angle was measured by the goniometer. To obtain a representative contact angle of the entire membrane surface, ten contact angle measurements were taken on various areas of the membrane coupon and averaged. 3. Results and Discussion Adequate mass balance tests are recommended in bench-scale membrane ﬁltration experiments to conﬁrm that rejection is not aﬀected by solute behavior such as volatilization, adsorption, or a reaction with the feed water matrix. Consequently, prior to the series of pressurized ﬁltration tests, a mass balance conﬁrmation experiment was conducted by circulating a feed solution containing 100 µg/L IBU at feed water pH of 4.0 units through the ﬂat-sheet equipment without a membrane coupon for 24 h. After analysis, 23% loss of IBU was observed during the experiment. 3.1. Eﬀect of Feed pH on Adsorption The test was repeated at a feed water pH range from 3.0 to 7.0 units, resulting in an inverse relationship between loss of enantiomeric IBU and the water quality parameter, aligning with the acid dissociation constant (pKa) of IBU (4.4). Figure 1 illustrates the results of the ﬂat-sheet equipment adsorption experiments, where the total IBU concentration adsorbed is presented as a function of the total initial IBU concentration. Due to the low Henry’s law constant (1.5 × 10−7 atm-m3/mol), volatilization could not explain observed IBU losses. However, in acidic conditions, IBU is known to adsorb onto and protect metal from corrosion [28,29], and IBU has been documented to attach to chromium-based metal organic frameworks [30]. It is noted that the ﬂat-sheet test equipment is comprised mainly of components that consist of stainless steel (16% chromium, 10% nickel, 2% molybdenum, and less than 0.02% carbon) [31]. Existing literature suggests that IBU adsorption onto the ﬂat-sheet stainless steel components (comprised of the reservoir, tubing, and chiller coil) could occur, as similar results have been realized with 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid [32]. Minimal to no attachment to the acrylic holding cells and permeate polyethylene tubing was observed. The bonding mechanism of IBU adsorption onto the surface was postulated to be between the hydrogen on the carboxylate functional group of the solute and adsorption of oxygen on the metal from the hydroxide moiety [33,34].

Eﬀect of Feed Concentration on Adsorption Although signiﬁcant adsorption onto the ﬂat-sheet equipment was observed, IBU has also been known to attach onto membrane surfaces at pH values less than its pKa of 4.4 [35]. Hence, experiments deciphering the extent of IBU adsorption onto the ﬂat-sheet equipment with and without a membrane coupon installed were conducted by repeating the experiment for a racemic solute concentration range from 100 µg/L to 1.50 mg/L. Feed samples were collected at 0 and 24 h. Triplicate feed concentration measurements were taken and averaged. Results in Figure 2 indicate that the adsorption of IBU increases with initial feed concentration, which agree with prior PhAC-metal attachment studies [29]. It also appears that the sorbed IBU concentration may approach a saturated equilibrium in due course, and hence can be modeled by adsorption isotherms (see Supplementary Information). An additional 19.6% to 39.2% IBU adsorption onto ﬂat-sheet equipment with membrane coupon was recorded. These results suggest that additional IBU adsorption presumably occurred onto the membrane surface. IBU adsorption onto the membrane components was validated by an increase in hydrophobicity (measured by contact angle), illustrated in Figure 3. Hydrophobicity was found to have a positive direct relationship with the concentration of adsorbed IBU. Mechanisms of adsorption could include both hydrophobic interactions and the formation of hydrogen bonds between IBU and the membrane surface [36]. Previous studies have attributed IBU adsorption only to the membrane surface, neglecting to fully understand the behavior of IBU, hence, conceivably reporting inaccurate rejection values in ﬂat-sheet studies [37–40]. At an initial racemic concentration of 1.08 mg/L, 83.7 µg/L IBU adsorbed onto the equipment and NF270 membrane. On the contrary, at an initial racemic content of 840 µg/L, 93.6 µg/L IBU adsorbed onto the equipment and TS40 membrane. Therefore, the TS40 membrane contained a slightly higher capacity to adsorb IBU. The diﬀerence of adsorption could not be explained by pore size or surface hydrophobicity. Although the NF270 membrane is more hydrophobic and has a larger MWCO, it did not adsorb as much IBU as the TS40 component. Others have postulated similar ﬁndings [35]. Membranes 2020, 10, 383 5 of 13 It should be noted that static batch experiments investigating IBU adsorptive capabilities on membrane coupons have been conducted elsewhere [35]. Batch adsorption experiments often do not represent actual attachment capacities of membrane while in pressurized operation [32], and thus were not included in the scope of this work.

Contact angle snapshots provide a visual image of the linear relationship between hydrophobicity and adsorbed IBU. An apparent diﬀerence between the adsorption of R- and S-IBU onto the metal surface was noted. At an initial racemic concentration of 100 µg/L, S-IBU adsorbed 4.82 times more than its R-counterpart. The ratio fell to 2.25 at an initial racemic concentration of 1.50 mg/L. Although current literature on the adsorption behavior of enantiomers is scarce, some have claimed IBU can enantioselectively adsorb onto chromium- and vanadium-based metal organic frameworks [30]. Additionally, S-IBU has been reported to adsorb up to 10 times more than the R-enantiomer on a liposome membrane [41]. In liposomes, enantioselectivity was ascribed to hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions between the asymmetric carbons of the chiral molecule and the spherical vesicle. A possible explanation for the disparate enantiomer behavior could reside in optimized molecular geometry between R- and S-IBU performed by density functional theory (DFT) computations [42,43]. In conjunction with experimental studies, DFT computations can provide insight to the contrary behavior of chiral molecules, as previously illustrated by D-alanine’s enantioselective adsorptive behavior [44]. The DFT framework in this study utilized the gradient correction non-local correlation functional of Lee, Yang, and Parr (B3LYP) with a basis set of 6-31G*, using the online GAMESS software [45,46]. Table 2 presents a comparison of the DFT-derived total energies and geometric properties of R- and S-IBU. Table 2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculated energy and geometries of R- and S-IBU.

The larger surface area, molecular volume, and smaller dipole moment of R-IBU suggest a bulkier, more hindered approach as compared with S-IBU. It should be noted that the ratio of S- to R-IBU dipole moments (2.68) compares well with the adsorption selectivity at initial racemic concentrations greater than 300 µg/L (2.46). Other conceivable explications for the dissonant chiral behavior include the Easson–Stedman three-point “lock and key” hypothesis between the chemical and binding site [48,49] or the slightly unequal opposite optical rotations of the enantiomers [50]. 3.3. Adsorption Isotherm Modeling Adsorption isotherms can be used to describe the relationship between the quantity of IBU attached on a solid surface in relation to its surrounding aqueous concentration at a constant temperature and pressure [51]. The concentration of IBU adsorbed to the solid surface at quasi-equilibrium (qe) is calculated by Equation (1): qe = (Co −Ce)V A (1) where qe is the concentration of IBU on solid surface (µg/cm2), Co is the initial concentration of IBU in aqueous solution (µg/L), Ce is the equilibrium concentration of IBU in aqueous solution (µg/L), V is the volume of aqueous solution (L), and A is the surface area of solid surface (cm2). In this work, Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherms were utilized to model the adsorption behavior of IBU [51–57]. Manipulations of qe and Ce for R- and S-IBU were plotted in accordance with the Langmuir, Freundlich, or Temkin isotherms to determine the best-ﬁt model for the adsorption system. Isotherms were ascertained for error using coeﬃcient of determination (r2), relative percent diﬀerence (RPD), some of square errors (ERRSQ), and root mean square error (RMSE) [56]. Derived parameters and statistical error are shown in Table 3. The variables KL and qa represent Langmuir adsorption constants, KF and n represents Freundlich adsorption constants, and the and KT and b represent Temkin adsorption constants. From Table 3, the Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherms yielded r2 values > 0.90, authenticating adsorption equilibrium tendencies for experimental data. Favorable adsorption was observed in the Freundlich isotherm as 1/n values were < 1 for R- and S-IBU. Adsorption intensities denoted by constants KL, KF, and KT were higher for S-IBU. Furthermore, greater Langmuir maximum adsorption capacities (qa) were also observed for S-IBU, aligning with the favorable adsorption presented herein. Larger concentrations of adsorbed IBU on the surface (qe) were experienced in the equipment-IBU-membrane system, highlighting the additional adsorptive capacity of the membrane surface. The Langmuir, Freundlich, and Temkin isotherms yielded similar predictability for IBU equilibrium concentrations up to 350 µg/L but diverged as solute content increased. Error analysis revealed that the Langmuir isotherm best modeled the equipment-IBU relationship. A Langmuir adsorption model ﬁt insinuates an equal quantity of attachment free-energy changes and a monolater coating of IBU on the surface. Similar results have been realized in applications utilizing stainless steel as the adsorbent [57–59]. Therefore, the equipment-IBU relationship can be modeled via Langmuir > Temkin > Freundlich. On the contrary, the Freundlich isotherm revealed the closest representation to the range of equipment-IBU-membrane system experimental data based on error analysis. A best-ﬁt Freundlich adsorption isotherm suggests heterogeneous adsorption free-energy changes and a multilayer of IBU chemisorption. These ﬁndings align with existing literature denoting Freundlich-type adsorption on a membrane surface due to its laminose structure [35,60]. However, it should be noted that the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms produced analogous r2 values for R-IBU (0.995 for NF270 and 0.996 for TS40), and contained similar error statistics. This suggests that as S-IBU has a stronger attachment aﬃnity, weak interactions between R-IBU and the surface may yield a thinner adsorptive layer. A study of R- and S-IBU adsorption kinetics onto metal and membrane surfaces may elucidate the dissimilar Membranes 2020, 10, 383 8 of 13 attachment mechanisms. For the purposes of this work, the equipment-S-IBU-membrane system can be modeled via Freundlich > Temkin > Langmuir, whereas the equipment-R-IBU-membrane system can be modeled via Freundlich = Langmuir > Temkin.

Rejection of Ibuprofen Enantiomers The eﬀect of pH on IBU rejection via NF was investigated by altering the feed pH to 4.0, 5.0, or 6.0 units with an initial IBU concentration of 1.5 mg/L (R- and S-enantiomer concentrations of 750 µg/L). Figure 4 displays the rejection of R- and S-IBU from the NF270 and TS40 membrane at a feed pH of 4.0 units. The total NF270 and TS40 IBU rejection was 34.5% and 49%, respectively. However, the adsorption of IBU aﬀected the rejection value based on the time of collection. Adsorption accounted for 14.3% to 23.4% and 23.6% to 31.3% of R-IBU and S-IBU rejection, respectively. The NF270 and TS40 exhibited poor (<50%) rejection at a feed water pH of 4.0 units. However, removal eﬃcacy increased with feed water pH, as illustrated in Figure 4, aligning with ﬁndings from others [37,38]. The feed water pH aﬀects the speciation of IBU and the magnitude of negative charge on the NF membrane. It should be noted that feed water pH has an opposing eﬀect on IBU adsorption. At feed water pH values higher than 4.4 units, the membrane surface is negatively charged and IBU is dissociated, primarily existing in the anionic form. Anionic IBU is believed to be rejected by electrostatic Membranes 2020, 10, 383 9 of 13 repulsion and steric hindrance. Conversely, at a feed water pH less than 4.4 units, IBU principally exists as the neutral form, and the membrane is less negatively charged. Neutral IBU readily adsorbs onto stainless steel and the membrane surface. As available adsorptive sites become saturated, the NF membrane can partially reject neutral IBU due to size exclusion. Therefore, the mechanism of IBU removal at acidic conditions is postulated as initially adsorption and subsequently steric hindrance. Figure 4. R- and S-IBU rejection as a function of feed water pH for NF270 membrane (left), TS40 membrane (right) (water ﬂux 42.4 L/m2h, temperature 20 ± 1 ◦C). It should be noted that the rejection of S-IBU was consistently greater than the R-enantiomer for the feed pH conditions examined, due to the preferential attachment onto the metal ﬂat-sheet equipment, shown in Figure 5. Although CEC adsorption impacts the overall rejection, it should not impact the mechanism of removal by the membrane. This indicates that the membrane may have a slight aﬃnity for the rejection of S-IBU. A possible explanation for the increased rejection lies in DFT calculations, which revealed a dipole moment of 2.02 and 5.40 Debeye for R- and S-IBU, respectively. Existing literature suggests that a molecule’s polarity inﬂuences the orientation of the solute relative to the membrane [15,16]. A molecule with a lower dipole moment is less polar, and hence contains an orientation more perpendicular to the membrane surface, increasing the probability of the solute to travel through the material without being rejected. Others have also found a direct relationship between CEC dipole moment and rejection [14–16,61]. The inﬂuence of sample time is important when recording removal of hydrophobic CECs like IBU from a NF process. In this work, adsorption was recorded over 24 h, and rejection was collected at 24 h. Others have agreed that 24 h of operation was adequate for equilibration of hydrophobic compounds [12,13,32]. However, additional time may be required to conﬁrm complete adsorption of the compound. If rejection is collected shortly after start-up, the value may not account for the adsorption of the CEC onto the membrane or equipment. Therefore, system equilibration is important in obtaining accurate removal capacities.

Conclusions The results of this study revealed the behavior of IBU enantiomers in aqueous solutions treated by NF membranes. Feed water characteristics (such as pH) have a substantial inﬂuence on the rejection and adsorption mechanisms of IBU. At low feed pH values, S-IBU adsorbed up to ﬁve times more than its R-counterpart onto stainless steel and showed preferential rejection in a NF process. DFT calculations could provide insight into the diﬀering behavior of the enantiomers in terms of molecular volume and dipole moment. In bench-scale membrane removal studies, it is important to conduct initial mass balance experiments to determine possible losses of compound, which may impact overall removal. Furthermore, equilibration time proves vital in determination of the true removal capabilities of membrane processes.
